# PhysiCell Mini One-Hour Short Course 
This mini course is a brief sampling and first exposure to simulation modeling in PhysiCell. We'll briefly introduce key agent-based modeling concepts and walk through a cancer simulation model, without need for coding. 

The work can be done in a web browser or in PhysiCell Studio, and no background coding (or deep knowledge of biology) is required.

Other PhysiCell online training courses can be found at https://PhysiCell.org/Training.html 

## Pre-requisites 
* Background knowledge: Basic knowledge of biology, and concepts of mathematical functions.
* Read the [Introduction](https://github.com/physicell-training/essentials/blob/main/README.md#introduction) from the **PhysiCell Essentials** short course
* Software setup: Web browser, or optional PhysiCell Studio Desktop

## Introduction 
Session 1: Introduction and a guided cancer model walk-through 

After briefly introducing key concepts in agent-based modeling and our grammar for modeling signal-behavior relationships in cells, we use PhysiCell Studio (on Galaxy) to iteratively build a model of cancer growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and response to chemotherapy.
